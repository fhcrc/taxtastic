# The transaction and rollback/rollforward system used by Refpkg uses
# a data structure from purely functional programming called a zipper.
# The current state is augmented with an ordered list of previous
# states and an orderd list of subsequent states.  Rolling back to a
# previous state of the refpkg means pushing the current state onto
# the ordered list of subsequent states, and popping the first of the
# previous states to become the new current state.  Rolling forward
# again runs in just the opposite direction.

# The log is maintained only on the current state to save space.  This
# slightly complicates Refpkg.rollback and Refpkg.rollforward.  Log
# messages for rollforward transactions are stored with the future
# states to make keeping the log up to date simple.

# In order to have a sensible set of states, we want compound commands
# to only produce a single state.  That is handled by this transaction
# decorator.  Since Refpkgs are already not threadsafe, we can use the
# Refpkg itself to hold the current transaction.  If there is no
# transaction, then we start one, and only that outermost transaction
# will write a log message.  Further, that outer most command will be
# reverted as a whole.  Logging is set by calling self._log(msg), but
# it must be the last command run which might contain transaction
# decorated calls!  Thus
#
#  self.update_metadata(...)
#  self._log(...)
#
# works properly, but
#  self._log(...)
#  self.update_metadata(...)
#
# does not.  The update_metadata call will overwrite the log that was
# set by _log.
