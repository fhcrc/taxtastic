"""Undo an operation performed on a refpkg.

Rollback ``N`` operations on ``refpkg`` (default to 1 operation if
``-n`` is omitted).  This is equivalent to calling the ``rollback()``
method of ``taxtastic.refpkg.Refpkg``.  If there are not at least
``N`` operations that can be rolled back, an error is returned and no
changes are made to the refpkg.
