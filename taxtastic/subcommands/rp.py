"""Resolve path; get the path to a file in the reference package.

See online documentation for ``taxit create`` for a list of
permissible values for ``KEY``

For example, write the absolute path to the file containing the
phylogenetic tree in ``my.refpkg`` to stdout::

  taxit rp my.refpkg tree

Examine the contents of the seq_info file::

  less $(taxit rp my.refpkg seq_info)
