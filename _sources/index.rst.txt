taxtastic
=========

Taxtastic combines two pieces of functionality: extracting subsets of the NCBI taxonomy, and creating and updating reference packages of sequences for use with pplacer.  All this functionality is exposed to the command line by subcommands of the script ``taxit``.  Taxtastic also supplies a clean API for dealing with reference packages.  The taxonomy functionality is only available via the command line at the moment pending a complete rewrite of the taxonomy subsystem.
